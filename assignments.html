        <h2>Assignment 0: Dummy Assignment</h2>
        <p>This assignment defines an add_numbers function to sum two numbers. In the main block, two numbers are initialized, the function is called, and the result is printed to the console. The approach is simple and effective, fulfilling the task requirements.</p>

        <h2>Assignment 1: Data Collection and Analysis</h2>
        <p>This assignment involved analyzing elevator arrival data, calculating the probabilities of each elevator arriving, using weighted averages to find the optimal waiting location, and comparing average walking distances between different positions.</p>

        <h2>Assignment 2: KMeans Clustering Visualization Webpage</h2>
        <p>This assignment focused on implementing the KMeans clustering algorithm by initializing centroids manually or automatically and iteratively updating centroid positions and data point assignments. We ensured that data point positions remained fixed while centroids moved correctly, allowing the algorithm to converge properly. Ultimately, we visualized the clustering results to intuitively demonstrate the clustering process and the effectiveness of the algorithm.</p>

        <h2>Assignment 3: Singular Value Decomposition</h2>
        <p>The task was to apply Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) as a preprocessing step on the MNIST dataset and train a logistic regression model. First, the MNIST dataset was loaded, normalized, and split into training and testing sets. Then, an apply_svd_custom function was implemented to perform SVD and reduce data dimensionality. The logistic regression model was trained on the original and SVD-reduced data, measuring accuracy and training time. Different numbers of SVD components (784, 200, 100, 50, 20) were tested. In the final part, accuracy and training time were visualized as a function of SVD components, and the top 5 singular vectors were reshaped and displayed as 28x28 images. This provided insights into the trade-offs between dimensionality reduction and model performance.</p>

        <h2>Assignment 4: SiLatent Semantic Analysis (LSA) Search Engine</h2>
        <p> loaded the 20 Newsgroups dataset using scikit-learn and created a term-document matrix with TfidfVectorizer to represent the documents in vector space.

Next, I applied Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to reduce the dimensionality of the term-document matrix, capturing the most significant features. For query handling, I transformed the user's input into the same reduced space and calculated the cosine similarity between the query vector and the document vectors.

I built a Flask web application to handle user interactions, including an input field for queries and a display section for results. The top five documents relevant to the query are retrieved and displayed along with their similarity scores. Additionally, I implemented a bar chart visualization using Chart.js to graphically represent the cosine similarities of the top documents. Finally, I created a Makefile to automate installation and execution, and set up GitHub Actions for workflow integration.</p>

        <h2>Assignment 5: K-Nearest Neighbors</h2>
        <p>In this task, I developed a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classifier from scratch to predict bank customer churn. The steps included implementing the KNN algorithm with options for 
ùëò
k values and distance metrics. Data preprocessing involved combining datasets, handling categorical variables with one-hot encoding, scaling numerical features, and removing unnecessary columns. I used cross-validation with ROC AUC scores to evaluate model performance and performed hyperparameter tuning to find the optimal parameters. Finally, I trained the optimized model on the full training set, made predictions on the test set, and ensured the submission file was correctly formatted without duplicate IDs.</p>

        <h2>Assignment 6: Linear Regression</h2>
        <p>The goal of this assignment is to create an interactive webpage that demonstrates how adjusting parameters like sample size, mean and variance of the error term, and number of simulations affects the results of linear regression when there is no actual relationship between variables. Tasks include frontend design, backend data generation and regression fitting, and plotting scatter plots with regression lines, as well as histograms of slopes and intercepts. The experiment shows that increasing sample size stabilizes regression, adding noise increases result variability, more simulations make histograms smoother, and a biased error term shifts slopes and intercepts. Record a video demonstrating the app, explaining results, and summarizing findings.</p>

        <h2>Assignment 7: Hypothesis Testing and Confidence Intervals in Linear Regression</h2>
        <p>I built a web application using Flask to implement hypothesis testing and confidence interval calculations for linear regression. First, users input data parameters to generate random samples and fit a regression line. Multiple simulations provide distributions for the slope and intercept estimates. Then, by selecting a parameter and test type, we calculate the p-value for hypothesis testing and display the distribution and results in a histogram. Finally, we construct a confidence interval from the simulated data, showing the range of estimates and whether it includes the true parameter.</p>

        <p>This project uses the CLIP model to encode images and text into embeddings, measuring relevance via cosine similarity. Users can input text, upload an image, or provide both, with a parameter Œª to adjust their weight. PCA is also applied to reduce image features, enabling a comparison between original CLIP and reduced features. The process is implemented through an interactive GUI for querying and displaying results.</p>
