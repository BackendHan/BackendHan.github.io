    <div class="assignment">
        <h2>Assignment 0: Dummy Assignment</h2>
        <p>This assignment defines an add_numbers function to sum two numbers. In the main block, two numbers are initialized, the function is called, and the result is printed to the console. The approach is simple and effective, fulfilling the task requirements.</p>

        <h2>Assignment 1: Data Collection and Analysis</h2>
        <p>This assignment involved analyzing elevator arrival data, calculating the probabilities of each elevator arriving, using weighted averages to find the optimal waiting location, and comparing average walking distances between different positions.</p>

        <h2>Assignment 2: KMeans Clustering Visualization Webpage</h2>
        <p>This assignment focused on implementing the KMeans clustering algorithm by initializing centroids manually or automatically and iteratively updating centroid positions and data point assignments. We ensured that data point positions remained fixed while centroids moved correctly, allowing the algorithm to converge properly. Ultimately, we visualized the clustering results to intuitively demonstrate the clustering process and the effectiveness of the algorithm.</p>

        <h2>Assignment 3: Singular Value Decomposition</h2>
        <p>The task was to apply Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) as a preprocessing step on the MNIST dataset and train a logistic regression model. First, the MNIST dataset was loaded, normalized, and split into training and testing sets. Then, an apply_svd_custom function was implemented to perform SVD and reduce data dimensionality. The logistic regression model was trained on the original and SVD-reduced data, measuring accuracy and training time. Different numbers of SVD components (784, 200, 100, 50, 20) were tested. In the final part, accuracy and training time were visualized as a function of SVD components, and the top 5 singular vectors were reshaped and displayed as 28x28 images. This provided insights into the trade-offs between dimensionality reduction and model performance.</p>

        <h2>Assignment 4: SiLatent Semantic Analysis (LSA) Search Engine</h2>
        <p> loaded the 20 Newsgroups dataset using scikit-learn and created a term-document matrix with TfidfVectorizer to represent the documents in vector space.

Next, I applied Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to reduce the dimensionality of the term-document matrix, capturing the most significant features. For query handling, I transformed the user's input into the same reduced space and calculated the cosine similarity between the query vector and the document vectors.

I built a Flask web application to handle user interactions, including an input field for queries and a display section for results. The top five documents relevant to the query are retrieved and displayed along with their similarity scores. Additionally, I implemented a bar chart visualization using Chart.js to graphically represent the cosine similarities of the top documents. Finally, I created a Makefile to automate installation and execution, and set up GitHub Actions for workflow integration.</p>
