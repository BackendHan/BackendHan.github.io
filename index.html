    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>I am a graduate student of ECE at Boston University. During my time at school, I have learned a series of commonly used backend Java technology stacks and mastered common development frameworks such as SSM, Springboot, and SpringCloud.</p>
    <p>I have also learned about relational database MySQL and non-relational database Redis. In Java, I have studied the basics of Java, JVM, and JUC concurrent programming. I am proficient in using and mastering RabbitMQ and its underlying principles.</p>
    <p>During my studies, I have worked on two or three Java backend projects in both college and graduate school, gaining practical experience in developing backend applications.</p>
