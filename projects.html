        <h2>TikTok Short Link Sharing System</h2>
        <p><strong>Tech Stack:</strong> SpringBoot, SpringCloudAlibaba, RabbitMQ, ShardingSphere, Redis, MySQL, Sentinel</p>

        <h3>Project Overview</h3>
        <p>The TikTok Short Link Sharing System facilitates user convenience in sharing TikTok videos. When sharing to third-party platforms, it uses a short link in text format to enhance video distribution and sharing capabilities. The system supports high-concurrency short link redirection scenarios at its core and provides real-time analytics and tracking features to help TikTok analyze user sharing behavior and conversion rates.</p>

        <h3>My Contributions</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Implemented a Bloom filter to determine whether a short link already exists, achieving performance far superior to the combination of distributed locks and database queries.</li>
            <li>Utilized RabbitMQ message queue peak-shaving capabilities to handle the storage of monitoring information in high-traffic short link scenarios.</li>
            <li>Encapsulated cache-miss read functionality and optimized mass database query issues in update or expiration scenarios through a dual-judgment lock.</li>
            <li>Ensured data consistency between the short link cache and the database by using a database-update-then-cache-deletion strategy.</li>
            <li>Ensured idempotency in message queue consumption scenarios through Redis, guaranteeing that messages are consumed only once within a specified time frame.</li>
            <li>Used Redissonâ€™s distributed read-write lock to handle data modification for short links under heavy access conditions.</li>
            <li>To accommodate paginated viewing of short links in the system's back-end management, added a routing table for redirection functionality on top of short link data sharding.</li>
            <li>Used Sentinel to limit QPS (queries per second) for interface access, ensuring stable operation of the short link system and applying degradation when the rate-limiting rules are triggered.</li>
        </ul>
